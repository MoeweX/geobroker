# GeoBroker

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/moewex/geobroker/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/moewex/geobroker)

In the Internet of Things, the relevance of data often depends on the geographic context of data producers and consumers. Todayâ€™s data distribution services, however, mostly focus on data content and not on geo-context, which could help to reduce the dissemination of excess data in many IoT scenarios. We propose to use the geo-context information associated with devices to control data distribution.
For this, we designed GeoBroker, a data distribution service that uses the location of things, as well as geofences for messages and subscriptions, to control data distribution. This way, we enable new IoT application scenarios while also increasing overall system efficiency for scenarios where geo-contexts matter by delivering only relevant messages.

## Running the precompiled software

- In the *release/* directory, you can find pre-compiled versions of the GeoBroker software and an example client
- Instructions on how to use these Jars can be found in *release/README.md*.

## Compiling and running the project from source

As this project contains multiple git submodules, one needs to run the following after cloning/downloading the sources:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

### Using IntelliJ

- Import the project, choose Maven as the external model
- IntelliJ will automatically resolve all dependencies
- To start GeoBroker, run the main method of *de.hasenburg.geobroker.server.main.Server.kt* (you can find this class
 in the GeoBroker-Server directory)
    - This will start the server with a default configuration
    - You can provide your own configuration by providing the path to the configuration file as program argument
- A very simple client can be started by running *de.hasenburg.geobroker.client.main.SimpleClient.kt* (you can find
 this class in the GeoBroker-Client directory)
    - This client connects to GeoBroker and executes a set of simple actions
    
### Using the command line

- Run `maven clean package` in the root directory
- This will create two Jar files: *GeoBroker-Server/out/GeoBroker-Server.jar* and *GeoBroker-Client/out
/MultiFileClient.jar*
- Instructions on how to use these Jar files can be found in *release/README.md*

### Using docker

- Docker specific instructions can be found in *GeoBroker-Server/Docker.md* and *GeoBroker-Client/Docker.md*.
